    "lyric_orig": "Softly the spring winds whisper to me\nFeeling the sadness in the gentle breeze\nFrom the riverbank I see, moving so free\nHow far will you run? I follow silently\nLock them away with my memories\nRetell the tale the story sounds so sweet\nThough the darkness may descend, night will turn the day\nSmiling through the tears I know I'll find a way\n\nOnce again we're in the same old place same time\nAnd I know that I will use the same old line\nDon't you know that sometimes simple words they bring\nA miracle can't you see\n\nHold me baby I won't let go\nTake you to a place we both know\nA new world where no one ever can find us\nI will have the strength for us both\nFly you to the stars up above\nOh my love a dream of love made reality\n\nJust like a stray cat with nowhere to go\nSits in the corner feeling all alone\nGonna hold you in my arms, never be apart\nAll the things you fear they seem so far away\nWaiting for you at the usual place\nLook through the window staring into space\nWipe it clean so I can see peeking\nthrough the trees\nFloating up above the new moon cries to me\n\nLike the dream that lies there waiting for us both\nCatch you by surprise a shock but then you know\nJust like all the spirits on the sky above\nWe'll be reborn can't you see\n\nHold me baby I won't let go\nTake you to a place we both know\nScattered through the heavens\na never ending song\nI will have the strength for us both\nFly you to the stars up above\nOh my love a dream of love made reality\n\nI will have the strength for us both\nFly you to the stars up above\nOh my love a dream of love made reality\nOh my love a dream of love made reality",
